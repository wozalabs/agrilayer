# 🌾 AgriLayer Protocol

**A universal language for agricultural data**  
_The protocol that turns fields, practices, and yields into structured, verifiable, and interoperable infrastructure for the climate economy._

## ⚙️ What is AgriLayer?

AgriLayer is the **open protocol for modeling agricultural activity at scale** — built for MRV platforms, carbon markets, sustainability reporting, and AI-driven systems.

It brings together **geospatial intelligence, temporal traceability, and carbon alignment** into a single, composable data structure designed for real-world deployment.

- Structured and queryable by default  
- Designed for integration, not visualization  
- Built to reduce data friction across governments, platforms, and programs  
- Ready for the climate economy

> **Not a tool. Not a dashboard. A protocol.**

## 🚧 Status: Live, Piloting, and Evolving

AgriLayer is **live** and currently being deployed in **real-world pilots** with selected partners across agriculture, carbon, and climate-tech sectors.

This repository will house the core schema, documentation, and implementation guides — **but not yet**.

We’re taking this moment seriously.  
We’re moving carefully — and with purpose.

## 🤝 Interested in Building With Us?

We’re actively working with a limited group of early partners to test, shape, and extend the protocol in live environments.

If you're:

- Launching MRV or carbon tracking systems  
- Standardizing data across ag programs  
- Building open integrations or Earth data pipelines  
- Powering AI models for agriculture  
- Or designing public infrastructure that needs to scale

👉 **Contact the team at [hello@agrilayer.com](mailto:hello@agrilayer.com)**  
Let’s explore how to build together.

## 📅 Public Schema Release

The public release of the full protocol, schema definitions, and SDKs will be available soon.

> Until then: Watch this repo.  
> And if you're ready to build now — **you know where to find us.**
